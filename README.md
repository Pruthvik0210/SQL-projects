# SQL-projects
I did these SQL projects under database systems subjects at university of texas at arlington.

Here in part 1 I have created tables for given csv files and inserted data into those tables. aldo I have written simple sql queries to manipulae data from those tables. in part 2 I have written some advance sql queries to manipulate some complex data using relation b/w those tables and created simple UI using pyton and tkinter library to add new data in those tables considering all the constrains of sql and in extra part I have created these UI's for all tables and some more complex data manipulation tasks using similar technologies. PDF files contains detailed explanations for these tasks.
